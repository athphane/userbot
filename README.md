> A Telegram Userbot based on [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram)

This repository contains the source code of a Telegram Userbot and the instructions for running a
copy yourself. Beside its main purpose, the bot is featuring [**Pyrogram Asyncio**](https:////github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram/issues/181) and
[**Smart Plugins**](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/smart-plugins); feel free to explore the source code to
learn more about these topics.

I assume you will read this whole README.md file before continuing.

Quick Deploy on Heroku using the button down below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/athphane/userbot)

> Development in progress.

## Requirements
You're gonna need to get the following programs and services either installed on your server
or signed up for. You must do all. It is a cardinal sin if you don't.

* `virtualenv` installed so that the packages don't interfere with other system packages.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) on your server or a free server from 
[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). (I recommend Atlas as I used it during
development with no issues.)

* [carbon-now-cli](https://github.com/mixn/carbon-now-cli) on your server too generate code images for the
[carbon.py](/userbot/plugins/carbon.py) module. I use this CLI tool cause I don't know and couldn't get selenium
and chromedriver to work nicely on my server/code. I'll be nice and even give you the command to install this.
I assume you already have NPM installed. 
    ```
    Windows: npm install -g carbon-now-cli
    Linux: sudo npm install -g carbon-now-cli --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
    MacOS: I assume almost the same as linux ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    ``` 

## Installing
*One Click Deploy*

There is no one click deploy.. It was all a ruse. You have to deploy like how I deploy it...

*The way I deploy*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/athphane/userbot.git
cd userbot
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m userbot.
```

## Developing
To add extra modules to the bot, simply add the code into [userbot/plugins](userbot/plugins). Each file
that is added to the plugins directory should have the following code at a minimum.
```python
from pyrogram import Message, Filters

from userbot import UserBot

@UserBot.on_message(Filters.command('sample', ['.']))
async def module_name(bot: UserBot, message: Message):
    await message.edit(
        "This is a sample module"
    )
```

This example is only for Pyrogram on_message events. 

## Credits, and Thanks to
*  [Dan](https://t.me/haskell) for his [Pyrogram Library](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram)

*  [Colin Shark](https://t.me/ColinShark) for his [PyroBot](https://git.colinshark.de/PyroBot/PyroBot) which helped with
most of the useful functions used.

*  The people at [MyPaperPlane](https://github.com/MyPaperPlane) for their [Telegram-UserBot](https://github.com/MyPaperPlane/Telegram-UserBot)
that gave a ton of ideas on how and what modules to include in this userbot. 

*  [Baivaru](https://github.com/baivaru) for the ton of help that got me this far into making this repo.
